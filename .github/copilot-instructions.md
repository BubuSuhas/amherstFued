This is an Angular SPA for a Family Feud game. The app has two main endpoints/pages:
- Admin dashboard: Controls questions, answers, percentages, scores, and navigation to next question.
- Presentation page: Displays current question, options, percentages, and team scores.

Follow Angular best practices for state management and routing. Use components for admin and presentation views. Store game state in a service for easy sharing between components.
